# QuickApp DSL Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation plan for building the QuickApp DSL using Kotlin Script Engine + Code Generation approach. The plan is divided into 11 stages, each taking 2-3 days and delivering testable functionality.

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Minimal Viable Parser (3 days)
**Goal**: Parse `app("Name") { screen("main") { text("Hello") } }` and print structure

**Steps**:
1. Set up Gradle project with kotlin-scripting
2. Define minimal DSL interfaces (AppScope, ScreenScope)
3. Create script host that evaluates .kt files
4. Build simple AST data model
5. Unit tests for parsing variations
6. Print parsed structure as JSON

**Deliverable**: CLI that parses script and outputs AST

### Stage 2: Template-Based Generation (3 days)
**Goal**: Generate compilable Android project from AST

**Steps**:
1. Create file/directory generator service
2. Add resource files (icons, colors.xml)
3. Create Mustache templates for MainActivity, Manifest, Gradle
4. Implement package name derivation
5. Test that generated project compiles
6. Integration test with sample AST

**Deliverable**: Generator that creates Android project

### Stage 3: Build Pipeline (2 days)
**Goal**: CLI command that goes from .kt to .apk

**Steps**:
1. Create CLI with `build` command
2. Wire parser → generator → Gradle
3. Handle Gradle execution and output
4. Copy APK to working directory
5. Add proper error handling
6. Test end-to-end with minimal app

**Deliverable**: `quickapp build app.kt` produces APK

### Stage 4: Text & Column UI (3 days)
**Goal**: Support `text` in `column` with styling

**Steps**:
1. Implement text primitive with all parameters
2. Implement column with padding/spacing
3. Generate view construction code
4. Add dp/sp conversion utilities
5. Test various text styles
6. Test nested columns

**Deliverable**: Apps can show styled text in layouts

### Stage 5: Interactive Elements (3 days)
**Goal**: Working buttons and text input

**Steps**:
1. Implement button with onClick
2. Implement input with ID system
3. Add get() function for input retrieval
4. Generate event handling code
5. Test button → toast flow
6. Test input → button → log flow

**Deliverable**: Interactive apps with user input

### Stage 6: Navigation System (3 days)
**Goal**: Multi-screen apps with navigation

**Steps**:
1. Update generator for multiple screens
2. Implement screen registry in runtime
3. Add goTo() with backstack
4. Generate screen switching code
5. Test forward/back navigation
6. Test invalid screen handling

**Deliverable**: Multi-screen navigation works

### Stage 7: Row Layout & Images (2 days)
**Goal**: Complete layout system with images

**Steps**:
1. Implement row container
2. Add horizontal scrolling
3. Implement image primitive
4. Add asset copying to generator
5. Test mixed layouts
6. Test image loading

**Deliverable**: Full layout capabilities

### Stage 8: I/O & Utilities (2 days)
**Goal**: File operations, logging, toasts

**Steps**:
1. Implement readFile/writeFile
2. Add file path resolution
3. Implement log with proper tagging
4. Implement toast utility
5. Test file persistence
6. Test utilities in callbacks

**Deliverable**: Apps can persist data and show feedback

### Stage 9: Networking (2 days)
**Goal**: HTTP GET/POST functionality

**Steps**:
1. Implement httpGet with callbacks
2. Implement httpPost with form data
3. Add proper threading
4. Test with real APIs
5. Test error scenarios
6. Verify UI thread callbacks

**Deliverable**: Apps can make network requests

### Stage 10: CLI Run Command (2 days)
**Goal**: Complete development workflow

**Steps**:
1. Add run command to CLI
2. Implement ADB device detection
3. Add APK installation logic
4. Add app launch command
5. Test with emulator and device
6. Polish error messages

**Deliverable**: `quickapp run app.kt` installs and launches

### Stage 11: Testing & Documentation (3 days)
**Goal**: Production-ready quality

**Steps**:
1. Create example apps (calculator, todo, weather)
2. Add integration test suite
3. Document all DSL functions
4. Create getting started guide
5. Add error message catalog
6. Performance testing

**Deliverable**: Tested, documented, ready to ship

## Timeline Summary

- **Total Duration**: 27 days (approximately 5.5 weeks)
- **Core Functionality**: Stages 1-6 (17 days)
- **Full Features**: Stages 7-9 (6 days)
- **Polish & Deployment**: Stages 10-11 (4 days)

## Key Principles

1. **Each stage delivers working functionality** - Every stage produces something that can be tested end-to-end
2. **Clear dependencies** - Each stage builds on the previous one without requiring look-ahead
3. **2-3 day chunks** - Small enough to maintain focus, large enough to deliver value
4. **Testable boundaries** - Each stage has clear testing criteria
5. **Risk mitigation** - Core functionality (parsing, generation, build) comes first
6. **Feature progression** - Goes from "Hello World" to full interactive apps

## Success Criteria

- Each stage must have automated tests
- Each stage must produce a working deliverable
- Documentation updated with each stage
- No stage should block if delayed (can skip to next feature)
- User can build useful apps after Stage 6
